The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using
Hadoop. Begin with the
[Single Node Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html) which
shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation. Then move on to the
[Cluster Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) to learn how
to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.
